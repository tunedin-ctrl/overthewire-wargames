bandit 0-3

The challenges presented here are mainly used as revision for me which is not my main goal.
In the early stages, we just needed to use `cat`, `find` and `du` to pretty much solve most of the exercises. 
Therefore, no well-informed tutorial was made on these challenges.

use `cat` to read a file. If the file has '-' in front of it, then use `cat ./<filename>`
