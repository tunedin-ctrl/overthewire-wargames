After logging in, it just looks like a standard linux os without anything special. In the root folder, there is nothing, however after executing `ls -a`, there is a few hidden config files and a `.backup` folder which looks suspicious. In the `.backup` folder there is a `bookmarks.html` file which contained a lot of lines. Using grep on `bookmarks.html`, we located the password for leviathan1.
